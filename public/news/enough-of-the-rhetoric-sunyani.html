							<p>Years of “what ifs” and “what could haves,” but as the adage goes, “kasa tenten nto ponko,” to wit, talking so much does not buy you a horse. The Brong Ahafo region is unquestionably famous as a hub for the production of sports talent in the country. From Athletics to boxing, women’s football to men’s football, BA is peerless. </p>

							<p>The Brong Ahafo region currently boasts of the highest number of representatives in the country’s premier soccer competition, with Berekum Chelsea, Aduana Stars, Bechem United, and Techiman Eleven Wonders, all being BA based in Ghana’s sixteen-club premier league. Indeed, the current champions of the league, Aduana Stars, are also based in Dormaa in the Brong Ahafo region.</p>

							<p>So dominant is the Brong Ahafo region in soccer in the country that the current champions of the women’s league, Ampem Darkoa, as well as the holders of the Sanford women’s FA Cup, Prisons ladies, are all based in Brong Ahafo. In spite of the overwhelming dominance of the Brong Ahafo region in Ghanaian football, it is regrettable to note that the capital of the region, Sunyani, cannot boast of a single premier league club.</p>

							<p>As Paul J. Meyer puts it “Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.” The achievement of Aduana Stars in their short stint in Ghana football is a testament to the fact that, with the right systems and mechanisms in place, every team has the potential to be successful. There are four Sunyani based clubs in the ongoing first division league. While much cannot be demanded from sides like Nsoatreman FC and Young Apostles FC as a result of their relative inexperience in Ghana football, one cannot justify the mediocrity of BA United and Tano Bofoakwa.</p>

							<p> This is the tenth consecutive season that the “asuo a 3yiri p3ber3” lads are competing in the first division since their relegation from the premier division back in 2007. For a club which finished fifth and competed in the maiden edition of the Ghalca Top 4 competition few seasons ago after the withdrawal of Kumasi Asante Kotoko, having produced great players such as Dan Owusu, a prolific goal scorer and a former Black Stars player who was the first player to have won the Ghana topflight league's goal king on three consecutive occasions in 1974, 1975 and 1976, Akwasi Owusu, another prolific goal poacher and a former skipper of the Black Stars, Yaw Antwi, Kojo Poku Junior, to mention but a few, Bofoakwa Tano’s plight is embarrassing.</p>

							<p>Having been relegated in 2007, partly due to administrative lapses which saw the club lose points for using unapproved hose, Bofoakwa Tano have struggled to rediscover the status which once made them a dreaded force in Ghana football. Management after management, and CEO after CEO, have come and gone but the club still wallows in the lower echelons of Ghana Football. Clearly, whatever plans and strategies the club has adopted within the last couple of years hasn’t worked. New ideas and new direction is required. The obvious and most conspicuous challenge of the club has been the lack of continuity for Chief Executive Officers who have been tasked within the last few years to qualify the club to the elite division. Consistency and continuity are two commodities which are non- negotiable in association football.</p>

							<p>“Strategy must have continuity. It can’t be constantly reinvented,” Michael Porter once said. If Bofoakwa Tano must rediscover their lost mettle, they certainly need some continuity. Founded in 1959, Brong Ahafo United is one of the oldest clubs in the country. Just as Bofoakwa Tano, BA United has produced great players, a list which includes ex Black Stars player, the late “King” George Arthur. Indeed BA United remains the biggest soccer  brand in the Brong Ahafo region despite its current predicaments. Poor leadership and unhealthy politics have caused irreparable damage to BA United within the last 15 years, a situation which has seen the Sunyani giants spend 12 out of the last 15 years in the lower echelons of Ghana football. Currently in first division, under the leadership of former Bolton Wanderers star, Mustapha Riga, BA United hopes to rediscover their lost mettle, which once made them a dreaded club in the Ghanaian league.</p>

							<p>With a divided supporting base, BA United have an arduous task of uniting their teaming folks, many of whom have become disenchanted with the club. It is instructive to also recognize the fact that some of the core and key supporters of BA United now have a divided loyalty as a result of the proliferation of soccer clubs in areas where these supporters hail from. BA United must come to terms with the reality; they don’t command the kind of support they used to some decades ago. However, that’s not the real problem. The real problem is that the club has no blueprint, no identity, no structures, and no definite route to success.</p>

							<p>Bofoakwa Tano and BA United must wake up. The rhetoric must cease. Structures must work. Competent people must be put at the helm. Continuity and consistency must be embraced. The soccer fans in Sunyani need a premier league club. Enough of the excuses. The time for action is now.</p>

							<h2>Pointing has no control about the blind texts</h2>
							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>
